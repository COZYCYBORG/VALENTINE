The Logic:
The backend of this quiz operates on a Linear Scoring Algorithm. Each of the 10 movies is stored as a unique key in a "Scoreboard" object, initialized at zero. When a user selects an option, the system identifies the specific movie ID linked to that answer and performs an increment operation ($Score_{movie} = Score_{movie} + 1$). After the fifth question, the logic executes a Math.max operation across the object keys to identify the winner. This ensures the result isn't a random guess, but a direct reflection of the cumulative "energy" chosen throughout the quiz.
4.The Final Cut (Result): The experience culminates in a "Movie Poster" which are provided result page that automatically triggers the specific BGM (Background Music) of the matched film, creating an emotional and high-impact conclusion. there should be a animation while the poster is revealed automatically playing the bmg in the background, movie poster along with the specific music bgm are attached.
5.The Countdown: A live timer leading to the Valentine’s Day "Premiere".
